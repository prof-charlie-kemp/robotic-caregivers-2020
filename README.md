# robotic-caregivers-2020
Code to help with the last 6 lectures of the Georgia Tech class Robotic Caregivers: From Dreams to Reality. COVID-19 has changed everything, so this code is likely to be rough and hastily written. 

Open course materials can be found at the following class website: 

http://pwp.gatech.edu/robotic-caregivers-2020/

You can try the Jupyter notebook on visual servoing with the following link: 

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/prof-charlie-kemp/robotic-caregivers-2020/master

After things have loaded, click on ./jupyter_20200412/visual_servo.ipynb and run the notebook code to see an idealized model of visual servoing.
